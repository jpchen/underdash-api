# Underscore - Lodash Documentation

Documentation to translate lodash [4.17.2](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.2) to underscore  [1.8.3](http://devdocs.io/underscore/) and vice versa. Will probably add ES6 native methods someday (read: if you're interested please contribute).

# Contributing
This has been a pretty manual effort based on a by-need basis for my own research. If you have ways to automate this, that would be very helpful, especially when new versions come out (assuming they do not [merge](https://github.com/underdash/underdash/issues/14)).

Slate messes up the scrolling formatting for 'include' files so everything is in index for now.

Made with [Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate)

Thanks to the developers that support lodash and underscore.
